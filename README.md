## Face Generation

This repository contains my solution for Udacity's fourth Deep Learning Nanodegree project. 
This project generates new images of faces that look as realistic as possible using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). To train the adversarial network, we are going to use the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
